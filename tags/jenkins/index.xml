Bruno presented Rundeck first, and how it can be used to automate operations.
And then I explained how we used it at RTL, to build a Continuous Deployment pipeline using Jenkins and Nexus:
for our staging environment, we enabled a continuous deployment workflow - which we called &amp;ldquo;0-click deployment&amp;rdquo; for our production environment, we enabled a continuous delivery workflow - which we called &amp;ldquo;1-click deployment&amp;rdquo; Read the full meetup report - in french.</description></item><item><title>Jenkins Rundeck Plugin</title><link>/projects/creations/jenkins-rundeck-plugin/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/creations/jenkins-rundeck-plugin/</guid><description>In 2011, I wrote a Jenkins plugin to integrate Rundeck as a &amp;ldquo;publisher&amp;rdquo;: the Rundeck plugin.
This plugin allows the creation of continuous delivery pipelines, using Jenkins to build your software and Rundeck to deploy it. I talked about it at the Paris DevOps meetup in march 2011: Continuous Deployment with Jenkins and Rundeck.
Note that this plugin is now maintained by the Rundeck team, and is still used by many people.</description></item></channel></rss>
