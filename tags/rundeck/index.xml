Bruno presented Rundeck first, and how it can be used to automate operations.
And then I explained how we used it at RTL, to build a Continuous Deployment pipeline using Jenkins and Nexus:
for our staging environment, we enabled a continuous deployment workflow - which we called &amp;ldquo;0-click deployment&amp;rdquo; for our production environment, we enabled a continuous delivery workflow - which we called &amp;ldquo;1-click deployment&amp;rdquo; Read the full meetup report - in french.</description></item><item><title>Jenkins Rundeck Plugin</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/creations/jenkins-rundeck-plugin/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/creations/jenkins-rundeck-plugin/</guid><description>In 2011, I wrote a Jenkins plugin to integrate Rundeck as a &amp;ldquo;publisher&amp;rdquo;: the Rundeck plugin.
This plugin allows the creation of continuous delivery pipelines, using Jenkins to build your software and Rundeck to deploy it. I talked about it at the Paris DevOps meetup in march 2011: Continuous Deployment with Jenkins and Rundeck.
Note that this plugin is now maintained by the Rundeck team, and is still used by many people.</description></item><item><title>Rundeck API Java Client</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/creations/rundeck-api-java-client/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/creations/rundeck-api-java-client/</guid><description>In 2011, following the Jenkins Rundeck plugin, I extracted the code that talked to the Rundeck REST API into its own project: the Rundeck API Java Client.
The goal was to be able to write more software in Java using Rundeck's REST API, for example the Rundeck Remote CLI, or writing scripts
Note that this project is now maintained by the Rundeck team at rundeck/rundeck-api-java-client, and is still used by many projects/people.</description></item></channel></rss>
