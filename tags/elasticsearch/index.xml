It is written in Scala and uses the Flowdock REST API to retrieve data, and the Elastic4s scala lib to populate the Elasticsearch index. I also contributed to the Elastic4s open-source project.
Here is a screenshot of the Kibana dashboard:</description></item><item><title>Elastic4s</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/contributions/elastic4s/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/contributions/elastic4s/</guid><description>Elastic4s is an Elasticsearch client for Scala.
In 2014, while working on a Scala-based CMS - Content Management System - with an integrated search engine based on Elasticsearch, I found myself using the Elastic4s open-source project. And as it often happens, not all our use-cases were covered by the existing features, so I contributed a few new features.
See all my contributions.
At some point I also became a committer on the project.</description></item></channel></rss>
