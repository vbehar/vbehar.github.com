I started using it while it was still a young project, in september 2018.
I made various contributions to different components of this open-source project:
jx - the core component jenkins-x-platform - the Helm chart for Jenkins X jenkins-x-builders - the container images definitions jenkins-x-image - the container image definition for Jenkins exposecontroller - a component used to automatically exposes services to the Internet updatebot - a tool used to create Pull Requests to propagate releases when working with Gitops I also wrote an asdf plugin for Jenkins X: asdf-jx.</description></item><item><title>Helm Ecosystem</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/contributions/helm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/contributions/helm/</guid><description>Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. It is the tool most people use to package their applications, and then deploy on Kubernetes. It is also the core of an ecosystem growing every day: plugins, wrapper tools, charts, &amp;hellip;
I have been contributing to a few open-source projects in the Helm ecosystem:
Helmfile - a &amp;ldquo;declarative spec for deploying helm charts&amp;rdquo; Helm Tiller plugin - a plugin for running Helm in &amp;ldquo;tiller-less&amp;rdquo; mode in Helm 2 Helm charts - various contributions to common charts I've been using</description></item><item><title>Osiris</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/contributions/osiris/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/contributions/osiris/</guid><description>Osiris is &amp;ldquo;a general purpose, scale-to-zero component for Kubernetes&amp;quot;. As explained in the Zero cost preview environments on Kubernetes with Jenkins X and Osiris blog post I wrote, Osiris is an excellent tool to keep a Jenkins X cluster size under control.
I contributed multiple new features and bug fixes to Osiris.</description></item><item><title>Various OpenShift-related projects</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/creations/openshift-projects/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/creations/openshift-projects/</guid><description>In 2015-2016, while using OpenShift, I developed a few small open-source projects on top of the Kubernetes/OpenShift APIs:
OpenShift Dashboard OpenShift Cucumber OpenShift GitHub Hooks OpenShift/Git Integration OpenShift Flowdock Notifier OpenShift Dashboard When I started using OpenShift, I quickly realized that it was missing a global view of the cluster state. In August 2015 I developed a Web Dashboard for visualization of multi-projects resources in OpenShift.
This gave me the opportunity to learn the OpenShift/Kubernetes API early on, and improve my Go skills - by reading the OpenShift and Kubernetes code bases.</description></item><item><title>OpenShift</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/contributions/openshift/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/projects/contributions/openshift/</guid><description>OpenShift is a Kubernetes &amp;ldquo;distribution&amp;rdquo; developed by Red Hat.
In the summer of 2015 I started using this newly announced platform, and as always when working with new projects, found a lot of opportunities for improvements.
This is how I contributed new features, bug fixes, bug reports and documentation in:
OpenShift Origin - including support for custom Dockerfile path when building Docker images OpenShift source-to-image - the tool used to build container images without using Dockerfiles OpenShift Documentation I also contributed to the OpenShift completion for oh-my-zsh plugin.</description></item></channel></rss>
