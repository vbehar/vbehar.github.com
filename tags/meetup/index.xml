In this talk, I focused on Jenkins X Preview Environments, and how we are using - and abusing - them at Dailymotion, to build and test our ad-tech platform:
what is a preview environment, how it works and its lifecycle how we are testing &amp;ldquo;managed services&amp;rdquo; using preview Environments how we are customizing the environments using Helm how we are managing the environments and avoiding too many idle resources with Osiris Using Jenkins X at @dailymotion talk by @vbehar #ci #cd pic.</description></item><item><title>Migrating our CI/CD pipelines to Kubernetes with Jenkins X</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-02-meetup-cncf/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-02-meetup-cncf/</guid><description>At the Cloud Native Computing Paris meetup, at the february 2019 session, I gave a talk titled Migrating our CI/CD pipelines to Kubernetes with Jenkins X.
In this talk, I shared our experience migrating our Dailymotion ad-tech platform's CI/CD pipeline from Jenkins to Jenkins X on Kubernetes:
Why we chose Jenkins X What are the impacts How we did this migration, in term of processes, people, practices and tools Some of the issues we had, and how we solved them And of course the next steps!</description></item><item><title>Using Go to build a REST API: yes, it’s a good match!</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2017-11-meetup-paris-api/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2017-11-meetup-paris-api/</guid><description>At the Paris API meetup, at the novemver 2017 session, I gave a talk titled Using Go to build a REST API: yes, it’s a good match! with my colleague Mina.
In this talk, we explained how we are using Go to build our new ad-tech platform REST APIs:
how we wrote a custom DSL in Go to define all our endpoints how we test our endpoints with BDD-style scenarios how we handle versioning of our REST API, and the gotchas to avoid the benefits of using Go in term of monitoring Up first: @vbehar and Mina Gendi showing how @dailymotionEng uses #golang to build #API s.</description></item><item><title>Continuous Deployment with Jenkins and Rundeck</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2011-03-meetup-paris-devops/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2011-03-meetup-paris-devops/</guid><description>At the Paris DevOps meetup, at the march 2011 session, I gave a talk titled Continuous Deployment with Jenkins and Rundeck with my colleague Bruno.
Bruno presented Rundeck first, and how it can be used to automate operations.
And then I explained how we used it at RTL, to build a Continuous Deployment pipeline using Jenkins and Nexus:
for our staging environment, we enabled a continuous deployment workflow - which we called &amp;ldquo;0-click deployment&amp;rdquo; for our production environment, we enabled a continuous delivery workflow - which we called &amp;ldquo;1-click deployment&amp;rdquo; Read the full meetup report - in french.</description></item></channel></rss>
