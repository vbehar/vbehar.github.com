In this blog post I detail the technical challenges we had to overcome, and the benefits we got from using Jenkins X at Dailymotion.
The content of this blog post was also presented at the DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019 Conference in Lisbon, in my talk 1 year with Jenkins X.</description></item><item><title>1 year with Jenkins X</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-12-dwjw-lisbon/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-12-dwjw-lisbon/</guid><description>At the DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019 Conference in Lisbon, I gave a talk titled 1 year with Jenkins X.
In this talk, I shared our experience using Jenkins X at Dailymotion for more than 1 year: how we went from the &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; to the &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; with the &amp;ldquo;most innovative Jenkins X implementation&amp;rdquo;.
I explained how we adopted Jenkins X and its new practices – both on the organizational and technical side.</description></item><item><title>Interview with Digital Anarchist</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-12-interview-dwjw-lisbon/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-12-interview-dwjw-lisbon/</guid><description>At the DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019 Conference in Lisbon, I was interviewed by Alan Shimel from Digital Anarchist.

In this talk, I explained how to do CI/CD on Kubernetes, and went through our experience using Jenkins X on GKE at Dailymotion:
What is Jenkins X Why and how we adopted Jenkins X at Dailymotion – and the benefits How we went from the &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; to the &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo;, and ended with the &amp;ldquo;2019 Most Innovative Jenkins X Implementation&amp;rdquo;: our custom implementation, and the integration of some open-source projects like Osiris (for auto-scaling to zero), sops (for secrets encryption) or Helmfile (to define our staging/production environments and handle deployments)</description></item><item><title>Quand la pub de Dailymotion bascule sur Jenkins X</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-10-interview-lmi/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-10-interview-lmi/</guid><description>I gave an interview to Le Monde Informatique, a french IT news website, in october 2019, about Dailymotion&amp;rsquo;s adoption of Jenkins X.
More specifically, about Dailymotion&amp;rsquo;s ad-tech platform move to Google Cloud Platform and to Kubernetes, and its adoption of Jenkins X to run its CI/CD pipelines.
We talked about our custom implementation of Jenkins X, and open-source contributions. And of course the benefits of the migration.

In this talk, I first introduced Jenkins X, and then went through some of the benefits we gained by switching Dailymotion ad-tech platform&amp;rsquo;s CI/CD pipelines to Jenkins X: Preview Environments, easy promotion, Gitops, &amp;hellip;
I also explained how we adopted Jenkins X and did the migration, and finished with our open-source contributions as part of this migration.</description></item><item><title>Our experience running Jenkins X in production</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-04-cdconference/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-04-cdconference/</guid><description>At the Continuous Delivery in a Cloud Native World virtual summit, in april 2019, I gave a talk titled Our experience running Jenkins X in production.
In this talk, I explained Dailymotion&amp;rsquo;s reasons for selecting Jenkins X to run the ad-tech platform CI/CD pipelines, and shared our experience using it in production:
how we keep our Preview Environments under control using Osiris to scale them down to 0 when they are not used how we promote our releases to staging/production on different Kubernetes clusters using Helmfile – and the benefits of it.</description></item><item><title>Using and abusing Jenkins X Preview Environments</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-03-meetup-paris-cd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-03-meetup-paris-cd/</guid><description>At the Continuous Delivery Paris meetup, at the march 2019 session, I gave a talk titled Using and abusing Jenkins X Preview Environments.
In this talk, I focused on Jenkins X Preview Environments, and how we are using - and abusing - them at Dailymotion, to build and test our ad-tech platform:
what is a preview environment, how it works and its lifecycle how we are testing &amp;ldquo;managed services&amp;rdquo; using preview Environments how we are customizing the environments using Helm how we are managing the environments and avoiding too many idle resources with Osiris Using Jenkins X at @dailymotion talk by @vbehar #ci #cd pic.</description></item><item><title>Migrating our CI/CD pipelines to Kubernetes with Jenkins X</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-02-meetup-cncf/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-02-meetup-cncf/</guid><description>At the Cloud Native Computing Paris meetup, at the february 2019 session, I gave a talk titled Migrating our CI/CD pipelines to Kubernetes with Jenkins X.
In this talk, I shared our experience migrating our Dailymotion ad-tech platform&amp;rsquo;s CI/CD pipeline from Jenkins to Jenkins X on Kubernetes:
Why we chose Jenkins X What are the impacts How we did this migration, in term of processes, people, practices and tools Some of the issues we had, and how we solved them And of course the next steps!</description></item><item><title>Dailymotion's journey from Jenkins to Jenkins X</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-01-article-from-jenkins-to-jenkins-x/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-01-article-from-jenkins-to-jenkins-x/</guid><description>At the beginning of 2019, I wrote a blog post on Dailymotion&amp;rsquo;s Medium publication titled Dailymotion&amp;rsquo;s journey from Jenkins to Jenkins X:
it got more than 20k views in 1 year, it was re-published on CloudBees blog, it was translated in chinese by Wang Donghui, and published on InfoQ. You can read the full blog post on Medium.

In this talk, we explained how we are using Go to build our new ad-tech platform REST APIs:
how we wrote a custom DSL in Go to define all our endpoints how we test our endpoints with BDD-style scenarios how we handle versioning of our REST API, and the gotchas to avoid the benefits of using Go in term of monitoring Up first: @vbehar and Mina Gendi showing how @dailymotionEng uses #golang to build #API s.</description></item></channel></rss>
