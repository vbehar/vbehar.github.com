This plugin allows the creation of continuous delivery pipelines, using Jenkins to build your software and Rundeck to deploy it. I talked about it at the Paris DevOps meetup in march 2011: Continuous Deployment with Jenkins and Rundeck.
Note that this plugin is now maintained by the Rundeck team, and is still used by many people.</description></item><item><title>Rundeck API Java Client</title><link>/projects/creations/rundeck-api-java-client/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/creations/rundeck-api-java-client/</guid><description>In 2011, following the Jenkins Rundeck plugin, I extracted the code that talked to the Rundeck REST API into its own project: the Rundeck API Java Client.
The goal was to be able to write more software in Java using Rundeck's REST API, for example the Rundeck Remote CLI, or writing scripts
Note that this project is now maintained by the Rundeck team at rundeck/rundeck-api-java-client, and is still used by many projects/people.</description></item><item><title>Various OpenShift-related projects</title><link>/projects/creations/openshift-projects/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/creations/openshift-projects/</guid><description>In 2015-2016, while using OpenShift, I developed a few small open-source projects on top of the Kubernetes/OpenShift APIs:
OpenShift Dashboard OpenShift Cucumber OpenShift GitHub Hooks OpenShift/Git Integration OpenShift Flowdock Notifier OpenShift Dashboard When I started using OpenShift, I quickly realized that it was missing a global view of the cluster state. In August 2015 I developed a Web Dashboard for visualization of multi-projects resources in OpenShift.
This gave me the opportunity to learn the OpenShift/Kubernetes API early on, and improve my Go skills - by reading the OpenShift and Kubernetes code bases.</description></item><item><title>Flowdock to Elasticsearch</title><link>/projects/creations/flowdock2es/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/creations/flowdock2es/</guid><description>In 2014, I wanted to play with Elasticsearch and Kibana, so I created a small project to import data from a Flowdock instance into Elasticsearch, and then build a Kibana dashboard to visualize the Flowdock usage.
It is written in Scala and uses the Flowdock REST API to retrieve data, and the Elastic4s scala lib to populate the Elasticsearch index. I also contributed to the Elastic4s open-source project.
Here is a screenshot of the Kibana dashboard:</description></item><item><title>Cascading Flapi</title><link>/projects/creations/cascading-flapi/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/creations/cascading-flapi/</guid><description>In 2013, we were using Hadoop at Exalead, writing data processing pipelines with Cascading. But Cascading's Java API was&amp;hellip; not very friendly to use.
I wanted a more &amp;ldquo;fluent&amp;rdquo; API, so I wrote an OSS project on top of Cascading to provide a fluent API. I used Flapi, which is an API generator for Java, &amp;ldquo;generating &amp;lsquo;smart&amp;rsquo; interfaces for improved fluency in your code&amp;rdquo;.
The cascading-flapi project was used at Exalead to help write our data processing pipelines&amp;hellip; until switching to Spark.</description></item><item><title>Paris DevOps</title><link>/projects/creations/parisdevops/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/creations/parisdevops/</guid><description>In 2011, soon after the creation of the Paris DevOps Meetup group, I joined the team and help organize the meetups.
I built the parisdevops.fr using Jekyll on GitHub Pages: https://github.com/parisdevops/parisdevops.github.com
I wrote content on the website and organized meetups for a few months in 2011.</description></item></channel></rss>
