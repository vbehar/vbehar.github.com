One year after the initial blog post [From Jenkins to Jenkins X](/publications/2019-01-article-from-jenkins-to-jenkins-x/) published on [Dailymotion's Medium publication](https://medium.com/dailymotion), I wrote a follow-up titled **One year with Jenkins X**.

In this blog post I detail the technical challenges we had to overcome, and the benefits we got from using [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) at [Dailymotion](https://dailymotion.com/).

The content of this blog post was also presented at the [DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019 Conference](https://devopsworldjenkinsworld2019lisbo.sched.com/) in Lisbon, in my talk [1 year with Jenkins X](/publications/2019-12-dwjw-lisbon/).

You can read [the full blog post](https://medium.com/dailymotion/one-year-with-jenkins-x-66e1b29ffd93) on Medium.
