At the [Cloud Native Computing Paris](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-Computing-Paris) meetup, at the [february 2019](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-Computing-Paris/events/258880938/) session, I gave a talk titled **Migrating our CI/CD pipelines to Kubernetes with Jenkins X**.

In this talk, I shared our experience migrating our [Dailymotion](https://dailymotion.com/) ad-tech platform's CI/CD pipeline from Jenkins to [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) on Kubernetes:

- Why we chose Jenkins X
- What are the impacts
- How we did this migration, in term of processes, people, practices and tools
- Some of the issues we had, and how we solved them
- And of course the next steps!

Cover tools such as Kubernetes, Jenkins, Helm, Kaniko, GKE, Osiris, ...
