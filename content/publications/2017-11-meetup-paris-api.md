At the [Paris API](https://www.meetup.com/ParisAPI/) meetup, at the [novemver 2017](https://www.meetup.com/ParisAPI/events/243855587) session, I gave a talk titled **Using Go to build a REST API: yes, it’s a good match!** with my colleague Mina.

In this talk, we explained how we are using Go to build our new ad-tech platform REST APIs:
- how we wrote a custom DSL in Go to define all our endpoints
- how we test our endpoints with BDD-style scenarios
- how we handle versioning of our REST API, and the gotchas to avoid
- the benefits of using Go in term of monitoring
