At the [DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019 Conference](https://devopsworldjenkinsworld2019lisbo.sched.com/) in Lisbon, I gave a talk titled **1 year with Jenkins X**.

In this talk, I shared our experience using [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) at [Dailymotion](https://dailymotion.com/) for more than 1 year: how we went from the "hello world" to the "real world" with the "most innovative Jenkins X implementation".

I explained how we adopted Jenkins X and its new practices – both on the organizational and technical side.

I did go through our custom implementation of Jenkins X:
- the integration of [Osiris](https://github.com/deislabs/osiris) in the Preview Environments, to have auto-scaling to zero deployments,
- the use of [sops](https://github.com/mozilla/sops) to encrypt/decrypt our secrets, and store them encrypted in our git repositories,
- the use of [Helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile) instead of Helm for the staging/prod deployments, to deploy on multiple clusters,
- the use of [updatebot](https://github.com/jenkins-x/updatebot) to propagate new releases as Pull Requests everywhere, and merge them when needed

Unfortunately this talk was not recorded.
