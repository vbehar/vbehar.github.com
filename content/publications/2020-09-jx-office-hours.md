At the [Jenkins X Office Hours](https://jenkins-x.io/community/office_hours/), in september 2020, I did a demo of the **new UI for Jenkins X Pipelines** that we wrote at Dailymotion, and then shared as open-source with the Jenkins X community.

You can read more about it in the following Jenkins X blog post: [New UI to visualize your pipelines and logs](https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2020/09/23/jx-pipelines-visualizer/) - or check out the [github repository](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx-pipelines-visualizer).

Update: there was a more recent blog post on [New features in the pipelines visualizer UI](https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2021/01/18/jx-pipelines-visualizer-v1/).

And of course you can watch the demo on youtube:
