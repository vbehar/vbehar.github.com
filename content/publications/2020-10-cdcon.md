At the [cdCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/archive/2020/cdcon/) conference, in october 2020, I gave a talk titled **Dailymotion's Continuous Delivery Story**.

In [this talk](https://cdcon2020.sched.com/event/dpvQ), I explained [Dailymotion](https://dailymotion.com/)'s initial CI/CD-related issues back in 2018, and how we solved them:
- using practices from the [Accelerate](https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/) book
- using [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) - a CD platform which implements the practices from the Accelerate book
