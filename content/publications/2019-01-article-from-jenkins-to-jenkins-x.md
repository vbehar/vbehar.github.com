At the beginning of 2019, I wrote a blog post on [Dailymotion's Medium publication](https://medium.com/dailymotion) titled **Dailymotion's journey from Jenkins to Jenkins X**.

It got more than 20k views in 1 year.

This story was also re-published on [CloudBees blog](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/jenkins-to-jenkins-x).
