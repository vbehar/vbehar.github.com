I gave an interview to [Le Monde Informatique](https://www.lemondeinformatique.fr/), a french IT news website, in october 2019, about [Dailymotion](https://dailymotion.com/)'s adoption of [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/).

More specifically, about Dailymotion's ad-tech platform move to Google Cloud Platform and to Kubernetes, and its adoption of Jenkins X to run its CI/CD pipelines.

We talked about our custom implementation of Jenkins X, and open-source contributions. And of course the benefits of the migration.
