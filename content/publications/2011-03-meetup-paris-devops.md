At the [Paris DevOps](http://parisdevops.fr/) meetup, at the [march 2011](http://parisdevops.fr/blog/2011/03/17/compte-rendu-du-3-eme-meetup-paris-devops.html) session, I gave a talk titled **Continuous Deployment with Jenkins and Rundeck** with my colleague Bruno.

Bruno presented [Rundeck](https://www.rundeck.com/open-source) first, and how it can be used to automate operations.

And then I explained how we used it at RTL, to build a Continuous Deployment pipeline using Jenkins and Nexus:
- for our staging environment, we enabled a continuous deployment workflow - which we called "0-click deployment"
- for our production environment, we enabled a continuous delivery workflow - which we called "1-click deployment"
