At the [Continuous Delivery in a Cloud Native World](https://cdconference.io/) virtual summit, in april 2019, I gave a talk titled **Our experience running Jenkins X in production**.

In this talk, I explained [Dailymotion](https://dailymotion.com/)'s reasons for selecting Jenkins X to run the ad-tech platform CI/CD pipelines, and shared our experience using it in production:
- how we keep our Preview Environments under control using [Osiris](https://github.com/deislabs/osiris) to scale them down to 0 when they are not used
- how we promote our releases to staging/production on different Kubernetes clusters using [Helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile) â€“ and the benefits of it.
