At the [ScaleUp 360° Better Software](https://www.scale-up-360.com/en/better-software/) digital event in november 2019, I gave a talk titled **CI/CD on Kubernetes with Jenkins X**.

In this talk, I explained how to do CI/CD on Kubernetes, and went through our experience using [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) on GKE at [Dailymotion](https://dailymotion.com/):
- What is Jenkins X
- Why and how we adopted Jenkins X at Dailymotion – and the benefits
- How we went from the "hello world" to the "real world", and ended with the "2019 Most Innovative Jenkins X Implementation": our custom implementation, and the integration of some open-source projects like [Osiris](https://github.com/deislabs/osiris) (for auto-scaling to zero), [sops](https://github.com/mozilla/sops) (for secrets encryption) or [Helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile) (to define our staging/production environments and handle deployments)
