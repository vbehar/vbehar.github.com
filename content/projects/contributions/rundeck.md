[Rundeck](https://github.com/rundeck/rundeck) is an "*open source automation service*". As explained in the [Continuous Deployment with Jenkins and Rundeck](/publications/2011-03-meetup-paris-devops/) talk I gave in 2011, Rundeck is an excellent tool to build a Continuous Deployment pipeline, on top of [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/).

I wrote [a few contributions to Rundeck](https://github.com/rundeck/rundeck/issues?q=author%3Avbehar).
