[OpenShift](https://www.okd.io/) is a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) "distribution" developed by [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/).

In the summer of 2015 I started using this newly announced platform, and as always when working with new projects, found a lot of opportunities for improvements.

This is how I contributed new features, bug fixes, bug reports and documentation in:
- [OpenShift Origin](https://github.com/openshift/origin/issues?q=author%3Avbehar) - including [support for custom `Dockerfile` path when building Docker images](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/5976)
- [OpenShift source-to-image](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/issues?q=author%3Avbehar) - the tool used to build container images without using Dockerfiles
- [OpenShift Documentation](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/issues?q=author%3Avbehar)

I also contributed to the [OpenShift completion for oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/chmouel/oh-my-zsh-openshift) plugin.
