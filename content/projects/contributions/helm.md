[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager for [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). It is the tool most people use to package their applications, and then deploy on Kubernetes. It is also the core of an ecosystem growing every day: plugins, wrapper tools, charts, ...

I have been contributing to a few open-source projects in the Helm ecosystem:
- [Helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile/issues?q=author%3Avbehar) - a "*declarative spec for deploying helm charts*"
- [Helm Tiller plugin](https://github.com/rimusz/helm-tiller/issues?q=author%3Avbehar) - a plugin for running Helm in "tiller-less" mode in Helm 2
- [Helm charts](https://github.com/helm/charts/issues?q=author%3Avbehar) - various contributions to common charts I've been using
