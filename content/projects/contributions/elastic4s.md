[Elastic4s](https://github.com/sksamuel/elastic4s) is an [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) client for [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/).

In 2014, while working on a Scala-based CMS - Content Management System - with an integrated search engine based on Elasticsearch, I found myself using the Elastic4s open-source project. And as it often happens, not all our use-cases were covered by the existing features, so I contributed a few new features.

See [all my contributions](https://github.com/sksamuel/elastic4s/issues?q=author%3Avbehar).

At some point I also became [a committer on the project](https://github.com/sksamuel/elastic4s/issues/116#issuecomment-37792505).

While I don't use this project anymore, it is still alive and [used by companies](https://github.com/sksamuel/elastic4s#used-by) such as Barclays Bank, HSBC, Shazaam, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Canal +, Soundcloud, ...
