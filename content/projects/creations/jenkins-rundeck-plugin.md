In 2011, I wrote a [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) plugin to integrate [Rundeck](https://www.rundeck.com/open-source) as a "publisher": the [Rundeck plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/rundeck).

This plugin allows the creation of continuous delivery pipelines, using Jenkins to build your software and Rundeck to deploy it. I talked about it at the [Paris DevOps](http://parisdevops.fr/) meetup in march 2011: [Continuous Deployment with Jenkins and Rundeck](/publications/2011-03-meetup-paris-devops/).

Note that this plugin is now maintained by the [Rundeck](https://www.rundeck.com/) team, and is still used by many people.
