In 2015-2016, while using [OpenShift](https://www.okd.io/), I developed a few small open-source projects on top of the [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)/OpenShift APIs:

- [OpenShift Dashboard](#openshift-dashboard)
- [OpenShift Cucumber](#openshift-cucumber)
- [OpenShift GitHub Hooks](#openshift-github-hooks)
- [OpenShift/Git Integration](#openshiftgit-integration)
- [OpenShift Flowdock Notifier](#openshift-flowdock-notifier)

### OpenShift Dashboard

When I started using OpenShift, I quickly realized that it was missing a global view of the cluster state. In August 2015 I developed a [Web Dashboard](https://github.com/vbehar/openshift-dashboard) for *visualization of multi-projects resources in OpenShift*.

This gave me the opportunity to learn the OpenShift/Kubernetes API early on, and improve my Go skills - by reading the OpenShift and Kubernetes code bases.

Note that the [Kubernetes Dashboard](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard) was only [created in October 2015](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/commit/5861187fa807ac1cc2d9b2ac786afeced065076c) - a few months after this project.

See the [project GitHub repository](https://github.com/vbehar/openshift-dashboard) for more information.

### OpenShift Cucumber

We had quite a few applications to deploy to on our OpenShift cluster, and found ourselves writing more and more YAML files, to define our applications: deployment configs, but also build configs, OpenShift templates, routes, services, service accounts, roles, secrets, projects, and so on. I wanted to ensure that changes to these files won't break anything.

Our applications used a variety of languages: Go, Scala, Java, Javascript, so I selected a language-agnostic way to write tests: [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) tests, using BDD - Behavior-Driven Development.

This is how I wrote [OpenShift Cucumber](https://github.com/vbehar/openshift-cucumber): a collection of Cucumber steps definitions for the OpenShift and Kubernetes APIs. Think of it as the ancestor of both [Helm Chart Tests](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_tests/) and the [Helm Unit Test plugin](https://github.com/lrills/helm-unittest) - just [before Helm was even created](https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/94db53d0803034083a3a9b1c7a9a197c327eb6b0).

See the [project GitHub repository](https://github.com/vbehar/openshift-cucumber) for more information.

### OpenShift GitHub Hooks

This is a Kubernetes "controller" used to automatically *manages GitHub hooks for OpenShift BuildConfig triggers*. When working on a platform with lots of applications, you don't want to repeat the same tasks over and over, so you automate. You write tiny scripts first, and then production-ready software. This is a production-ready software we've been using to provide a self-service platform to application developers.

See the [project GitHub repository](https://github.com/vbehar/openshift-github-hooks) for more information.

### OpenShift/Git Integration

A Kubernetes "controller" used to automatically *import/export OpenShift resources from/to a Git repository*. Well, in fact, it only does the "export" part - the "import" was planned but never developed.

The short term goal of this tool was to automatically backup our OpenShift resources in a Git repository, thus enabling audit & history features on top of the Kubernetes API. That part has been developed and worked well, and helped us a lot.

The long term goal - which was never developed - was to do the opposite: read configuration from Git and apply it automatically to our OpenShift cluster. *Gitops* [before the name was even born](https://www.weave.works/blog/gitops-operations-by-pull-request).

See the [project GitHub repository](https://github.com/vbehar/openshift-git) for more information.

### OpenShift Flowdock Notifier

We were happy users of [Flowdock](https://www.flowdock.com/) as our communication tool, mainly for its *Inbox* feature, which makes it easy to separate communication between people and automatically-generated messages from different tools.

This project is a Kubernetes controller used to send automatic messages to Flowdock based on events happening in the OpenShift cluster. For example to be notified when a build is finished.

It was never finished, I had in mind to use the Kubernetes TPR (Third Party Resources) - the ancestor of the CRD (Custom Resources Definition) - to allow the users to define rules of events that would generate Flowdock notifications. 

See the [project GitHub repository](https://github.com/vbehar/openshift-flowdock-notifier) for more information.

None of these projects are maintained or used anymore.
