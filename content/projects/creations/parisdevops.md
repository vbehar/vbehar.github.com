In 2011, soon after the creation of the [Paris DevOps](http://parisdevops.fr/) Meetup group, I joined the team and help organize the meetups.

I built the [parisdevops.fr](http://parisdevops.fr/) using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/): https://github.com/parisdevops/parisdevops.github.com

I wrote content on the website and organized meetups for a few months in 2011.
