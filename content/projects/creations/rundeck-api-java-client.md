In 2011, following the [Jenkins Rundeck plugin](/projects/creations/jenkins-rundeck-plugin/), I extracted the code that talked to the [Rundeck](https://www.rundeck.com/open-source) REST API into its own project: the [Rundeck API Java Client](https://github.com/vbehar/rundeck-api-java-client).

The goal was to be able to write more software in Java using Rundeck's REST API, for example the [Rundeck Remote CLI](https://github.com/vbehar/rundeck-remote-cli), or [writing scripts](/rundeck-api-java-client/scripting.html)

Note that this project is now maintained by the [Rundeck](https://www.rundeck.com/) team at [rundeck/rundeck-api-java-client](https://github.com/rundeck/rundeck-api-java-client), and is still used by many projects/people.
