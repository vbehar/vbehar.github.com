In 2014, I wanted to play with [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) and [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana), so I created a small project to import data from a [Flowdock](https://www.flowdock.com/) instance into Elasticsearch, and then build a Kibana dashboard to visualize the Flowdock usage.

It is written in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) and uses the Flowdock REST API to retrieve data, and the [Elastic4s](https://github.com/sksamuel/elastic4s) scala lib to populate the Elasticsearch index. I also [contributed to the Elastic4s open-source project](/projects/contributions/elastic4s/).

Here is a screenshot of the Kibana dashboard:
