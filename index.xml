In this talk, I first introduced Jenkins X, and then went through some of the benefits we gained by switching Dailymotion ad-tech platform&amp;rsquo;s CI/CD pipelines to Jenkins X: Preview Environments, easy promotion, Gitops, &amp;hellip;
I also explained how we adopted Jenkins X and did the migration, and finished with our open-source contributions as part of this migration.</description></item><item><title>Our experience running Jenkins X in production</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-04-cdconference/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-04-cdconference/</guid><description>At the Continuous Delivery in a Cloud Native World virtual summit, in april 2019, I gave a talk titled Our experience running Jenkins X in production.
In this talk, I explained Dailymotion&amp;rsquo;s reasons for selecting Jenkins X to run the ad-tech platform CI/CD pipelines, and shared our experience using it in production:
how we keep our Preview Environments under control using Osiris to scale them down to 0 when they are not used how we promote our releases to staging/production on different Kubernetes clusters using Helmfile – and the benefits of it.</description></item><item><title>Using and abusing Jenkins X Preview Environments</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-03-meetup-paris-cd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-03-meetup-paris-cd/</guid><description>At the Continuous Delivery Paris meetup, at the march 2019 session, I gave a talk titled Using and abusing Jenkins X Preview Environments.
In this talk, I focused on Jenkins X Preview Environments, and how we are using - and abusing - them at Dailymotion, to build and test our ad-tech platform:
what is a preview environment, how it works and its lifecycle how we are testing &amp;ldquo;managed services&amp;rdquo; using preview Environments how we are customizing the environments using Helm how we are managing the environments and avoiding too many idle resources with Osiris Using Jenkins X at @dailymotion talk by @vbehar #ci #cd pic.</description></item><item><title>Migrating our CI/CD pipelines to Kubernetes with Jenkins X</title><link>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-02-meetup-cncf/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vincent.behar.name/publications/2019-02-meetup-cncf/</guid><description>At the Cloud Native Computing Paris meetup, at the february 2019 session, I gave a talk titled Migrating our CI/CD pipelines to Kubernetes with Jenkins X.
